# Calibration Guide

First-time setup after assembly. Refer to [assembly-guide.md](assembly-guide.md) if not yet assembled.

## 1. Adjust Vial Cradle Position

Slide the vial cradle along its adjustment slots until the label exit point on the peel plate aligns with the vial surface when a vial is seated in the cradle. Tighten the M3 hex nuts once positioned.

## 2. Adjust Dancer Arm Spring Tension

The spring should be:
- **Light enough** to allow the backing paper to feed freely without excessive drag.
- **Firm enough** to maintain consistent tension and prevent slack in the label path.

If the spring is too stiff, hook it to a lower anchor point or replace with a lighter spring.

## 3. Test Label Peel

Feed backing paper through the full path. Pull the backing paper past the peel plate edge and verify that labels separate cleanly from the backing at the peel edge. If labels do not peel, check that:
- The peel plate edge is sharp and smooth (sand lightly if needed).
- The backing paper wraps tightly around the peel edge with sufficient angle.

## 4. Height Check

Place a vial in the cradle. Verify that the bottom edge of the presented label sits approximately 3mm from the bottom of the vial. Adjust cradle position vertically if needed.

## 5. Width Check

Verify that the label tracks centered within the peel plate channel. If the label drifts to one side, adjust the guide roller bracket alignment.

## 6. Practice Technique

1. Place a vial into the cradle.
2. Roll the vial against the presented label at the peel plate edge.
3. Continue rotating the vial to wrap the label fully around.

Run through several labels to confirm consistent placement before labeling production vials.
