# Assembly Guide

## Prerequisites

- All parts printed per [print-settings.md](print-settings.md)
- All hardware from [hardware-bom.md](hardware-bom.md)
- Soldering iron with M3 insert tip

## Steps

### 1. Install Heat-Set Inserts

Set soldering iron to 220C (appropriate for ASA). Press each M3 heat-set insert into the frame mounting holes. Allow to cool before proceeding.

### 2. Mount Spool Holder

Attach the spool holder to the frame base using M3 x 8mm screws.

### 3. Install Dancer Arm Pivot

Press the 8mm x 50mm steel dowel pin into the dancer arm pivot hole on the frame.

### 4. Attach Dancer Arm

Slide the dancer arm onto the pivot pin. Install the 608 bearing on an 8mm x 20mm dowel pin and insert into the dancer arm roller position. Attach the extension spring between the dancer arm and the frame anchor point.

### 5. Mount Guide Roller Bracket

Install the second 608 bearing on the remaining 8mm x 20mm dowel pin. Mount the guide bracket to the frame using M3 x 12mm screws and washers.

### 6. Mount Peel Plate

Attach the peel plate to the frame wall using M3 x 8mm screws.

### 7. Position Vial Cradle

Place the vial cradle on the adjustment slots. Secure loosely with M3 x 12mm screws, hex nuts, and washers. Final position is set during calibration.

### 8. Thread Label Path

Route the label backing paper through the following path:

```
Spool --> Dancer arm roller --> Guide roller --> Peel plate
```

The label face should be oriented outward (away from the peel plate surface) so labels separate at the peel edge.

### 9. Test

Feed a label strip through the path and verify smooth travel before loading a full spool. Proceed to [calibration-guide.md](calibration-guide.md).
